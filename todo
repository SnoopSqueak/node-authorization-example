* Add the ability to "attempt" challenges by filling in the blanks and submitting to compare with the real answers

Authentication:
* Only display the formula on a number pattern challenge if you're the owner or if you have already solved it
* Guest users can look at challenges, and maybe even attempt them, without an account
* Standard users are guests plus the ability to create challenges, and the abilities to update and delete their own challenges
* Admin users are standard users plus the ability to delete ANY challenge

* integration testing would be nice, although it would take more time to be comprehensive than I have, so specs in this project will be light.
  There will be some for the authentication stories.
