* Add the ability to "attempt" challenges by filling in the blanks and submitting to compare with the real answers
* Make attempt button only visible to users who are signed in
* Signed in users can view the challenges they've completed, as well as view the solution on a particular challenge if they have completed it
* should users be able to give up on a problem to see the solution without solving it?

Authentication:
* Only display the formula on a number pattern challenge if you're the owner or if you have already solved it
* Guest users can look at challenges, and maybe even attempt them, without an account
* Standard users are guests plus the ability to create challenges, and the abilities to update and delete their own challenges
* Admin users are standard users plus the ability to delete ANY challenge

Wishlist:
* integration testing would be nice, although it would take more time to be comprehensive than I have, so specs in this project will be light.
  There will be some for the authentication stories.
* Allow users to rate difficulty and enjoyment of completed challenges, display those ratings on each challenge, graphs and things
* I feel like I have a lot of repeated code, it would be great to put the challenge rendering/parsing in one place... but not worth the effort right now.
  Often it's best to let things develop naturally...ish. I don't want to get in my own way, but I also don't want to go the wrong way.
  Maybe a numberPatternChallenge partial would help. I could include it in the new, show, attempt, edit, etc views. It could receive a flag to tell it
    whether to show blanks as underscores, checkboxes, or input text areas. That sounds smart, I may try that next time.
